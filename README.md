# Python_data
This repo contains all my excercise code written by during my learning process of python for data science.

To run:
1. Download jupyter and anaconda. or,
2. Use google colab, colab is powered by jupyter and runs online giving user a flexibility of not worrying about downloads.

NOTE: The notebook file is always in .ipynb format and cannot be opened directly, to open it one should open jupyter or colab and open through there.
